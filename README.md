This project analyzes the impact of valeric acid (VA) on colon organoids using bulk RNA-seq. The workflows cover data cleaning and normalization (edgeR/TMM), differential expression across cytokine stimulation and VA dosing/timepoint contrasts, and pathway/score analyses for inflammation, oxidative stress, and barrier integrity. We also include parallel analyses for 1000IBD mucosal data to compare VA-related signatures across patient samples. The scripts generate DEG tables, PCA/volcano/heatmap visualizations, KEGG enrichment plots, and inflammation/oxidative/barrier score summaries to connect molecular changes with treatment conditions.
